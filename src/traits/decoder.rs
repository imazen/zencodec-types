///

/// for PNG, etc. The caller pulls batches until `None` is returned.

/// Created by [`DecodeJob::streaming_decoder()`](super::DecodeJob::streaming_decoder)
/// with input data and format preferences already bound.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```text
/// let job = config.job();
/// let info = job.output_info(data)?;
/// let mut dec = job.streaming_decoder(&[], data)?;
/// while let Some((y, strip)) = dec.next_batch()? {
///     // process strip.rows() scanlines starting at row y
/// }

    /// or `Ok(None)` when the image is fully decoded.

/// Full-frame composited animation decode.
///
/// The decoder composites internally (handling disposal, blending,
/// sub-canvas positioning, reference slots, etc.) and yields
/// full-canvas frames ready for display.
///
/// Created by [`DecodeJob::animation_frame_decoder()`](super::DecodeJob::animation_frame_decoder)
/// with input data and format preferences already bound.
///
/// # Frame index
///
/// Frame indices are 0-based and count only displayed frames. Internal
/// compositing helper frames (e.g. JXL zero-duration frames) are consumed
/// internally and never yielded.
///
/// # Borrowed vs owned
///
/// [`render_next_frame()`](AnimationFrameDecoder::render_next_frame) returns a
/// [`AnimationFrame`] that borrows the decoder's internal canvas — zero-copy
/// but invalidated by the next call.
/// [`render_next_frame_owned()`](AnimationFrameDecoder::render_next_frame_owned)
/// copies to an [`OwnedAnimationFrame`] for independent ownership.
///
/// # Cooperative cancellation
///
/// Each render method takes an `Option<&dyn Stop>` token for cooperative
/// cancellation. The codec checks this token periodically during decode
/// and returns early with [`StopReason`](enough::StopReason) if
/// cancellation is requested.
///
/// Because `AnimationFrameDec: 'static`, the decoder cannot borrow the
/// job's stop token. Instead, the caller passes a stop token per call.
/// Codecs that also stored an owned stop at construction time (e.g. via
/// [`Stopper`](https://docs.rs/almost-enough/latest/almost_enough/struct.Stopper.html))
/// can combine the two with
/// [`OrStop`](https://docs.rs/almost-enough/latest/almost_enough/struct.OrStop.html).
/// Pass `None` when cancellation is not needed.
